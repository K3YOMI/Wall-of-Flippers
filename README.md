# üê¨ Installing and Requirements <a name = "doc_install"></a>

> A few things are required to properly run Wall of Flippers. We Recommend a Raspberry Pi as it's compact and portable! It's also required to have a `chipset` or a USB `adapter` that supports Bluetooth Low Energy. At this current time, there is `limited` support for Wall of Flippers on Windows. Hence we recommend using a linux based operating system as that has been used for testing and development. For BLE advertising, I recommened an external USB adapter as the internal adapter on the Raspberry Pi is not powerful enough to send BLE advertisments long range.  



## How to install <a name = "install_guides"></a>

<summary> Windows Install Guide </summary>

## Windows Install Guide <a name = "windows_install"></a>
> Windows is currently not fully supported. However, you can still run Wall of Flippers on Windows. A few missing features like the ability to detect advertisment attacks and ability to send advertisments. However the detection of the Flipper Zero device is still supported. To get started, we will need to clone the repository and install the required packages. To do this, we need to run the following commands in the command prompt. However, if you do not have git installed, you can simply install it by downloading it from the official website.

### Step 1 (One): Git Clone and Git Installiation 


	Download Link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

> Once you have downloaded git, you can now run the following commands below.

	git clone https://www.github.com/K3YOMI/Wall-of-Flippers
	cd ./Wall-of-Flippers


### Step 2 (Two): Installing python and pip (python / pip)
> This step is quite straightforward as we will be installing python and pip. To do this, we will need to download the latest version of python from the official website. Once you have downloaded the installer, you can run it and install python. Please make sure to check the box that says `Add Python to PATH`. This will allow you to run python from the command prompt. Once you have installed python, you can now install the required packages. 

	Download Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

> Once you have installed python, you can now install the required packages. To do this, we will need to run the following commands below.

	pip install bleak
	pip install requests


> Alternatively, you can use the requirements.txt file to install the required packages. To do this, we will need to run the following commands below.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

> If you would like to use the easy install script, you can use the following commands below.

	python WallofFlippers.py
	# You should get a prompt upon startup, press 4 for the easy install and follow the directions and prompts for the install.

> If you are having issues with pip being not recognized as a command, please refer to this question below:\

# Common Errors and Fixes <a name = "doc_c_and_e"></a>
### No such file or directory /sys/class/bluetooth
> If the `/sys/class/bluetooth` directory is not present on your system, it may indicate that the Bluetooth subsystem is not properly detected or enabled. To check if you have the right hardware, please run 

	sudo service bluetooth status

> If the status is `dead` you may not have a valid bluetooth chipset or adapter present. If `inactive`, you can enable the service using this command

	sudo service bluetooth restart




# Notice <a name = "doc_statement"></a>
> This project isn't the solution to combat the Flipper Zero device or any form of btle attacks. **THIS DOES NOT MITIGATE OR STOP ANYTHING**!!! However, the flipper zero device is a great tool for learning and understanding the inctracies of the cyberworld. Now for the detections for this project, we heavily rely on the advertisments that the Flipper Zero sends out for detection. While a user can do many things to avoid being detected by Wall of Flippers. (Depending if the Identifier method gets worked around) We highly advise using this project for an end all solution. While not all bluetooth attacks are sent from only the flipper, it's a good start to understand the world of bluetooth and the attacks that can be accomplished with simple devices. We hope you enjoy this project and we hope you take the time to learn and build off of this. We are always looking for contributions and new ideas. Thank you for looking at this project and we hope you enjoy it! -k3yomi and emilia0001
